Hi, I’m @bcoleman01.
I’m interested in sport of many forms, including the NFL and esports, as well as trivia games like Wordle and OEC Tradle.
I’m currently learning MySQL and Microsoft PowerBI, freshening up on HTML, and planning to tackle Python soon!
I’m looking to collaborate on locating new datasets to create queries and visualizations from.
